# comp163-assignment-4

## GAME INFO
My game is about using values given by the program to preform a choice-based game that takes ABC/inputs to output information about the classes and alterations in the values.

## BRANCHING EXPLAINED
In the first step of my code puts in values, second step uses if/elif/else and comparison operators((>=, <=, ==, !=), third step uses membership operators and logical operators, fourth step takes all the concepts from within the assignment and has nested if statements as well.

## HOW TO
The game is run by putting in ABC or study options based on what the program asks of you.

## DIFFERENT ENDINGS
The different endings show what would happen if you have a project, written exam, or oral exam.

## AI ASSISTANCE
No AI was used during my development but I did receive help from TA's.
